          <h4><br>A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates a demand deposit while simultaneously making loans. Lending activities can be directly performed by the bank or indirectly through capital markets. <br></h4>
          <h4><br> Because banks play an important role in financial stability and the economy of a country, most jurisdictions exercise a high degree of regulation over banks. Most countries have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking, under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, the Basel Accords. <br></h4>
          <h1 class="title">Why are banks so important?</h1>
          <h4><br> A well-functioning financial system is fundamental to a modern economy, and banks perform important functions for society. They must therefore be secure. <br></h4>
          <h4><br> Banks should be able to lend money to consumers and businesses in both upturns and downturns. In addition, payments for goods and services should be processed swiftly, safely and at low cost.

If banks fail to perform these tasks, the consequences for the entire economy could quickly become so wide-reaching that even the banking system would be exposed to large shocks. It is therefore important that banks are able to absorb losses and meet their current payment obligations. <br></h4>
          <h4><br> To ensure this, banks must comply with strict regulatory requirements. Among these are the capital and liquidity (money that can be paid on short notice) requirements applying to banks in order to ensure that they can meet their current payment obligations.

The banksâ€™ own payment systems are also required to be secure and efficient.<br></h4>
